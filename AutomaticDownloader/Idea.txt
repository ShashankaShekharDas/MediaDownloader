Idea:
(Diagram to follow later)
User sends a request to Kafka with the media Info (record MediaRecord)
The listener, listens to the request and based on priority, forced cluster, routes it to another kafka topic

The specific machines listen to their corressponding kafka topic (every 5 minutes), downloads
And (maybe) uplaods to cloud


In future to be fixed:
1) In future, ideal 3 partition, 3 replciation and 3 broker hosts
2) Downloads for now SHOULD support vadapav and torrent. Torrent has to find a cli to work with
